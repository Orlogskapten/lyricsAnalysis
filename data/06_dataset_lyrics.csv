Eminem,2017,Revival,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/offended.html,rap,You claim if you get knocked by the cops Youll give em not even a statement Walk in the arraignment shoot the bailiff Karate kick the plaintiff Gotti with the stainless Ill just call it shoddy entertainment If yall was in the party gettin faded On molly had the audience sedated You wouldnt catch a body if it fainted Probably let it fall and hit the pavement But youd be the first lobbyin to claim it Bitch stop bein a lame Your hobby isnt robbery and dismemberin body limbs Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells And chainsawing them in the basement Hardly fits your job description Aint nobody dippin out the back of the club like quotOh my God hes trippinquot Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment aint it Wouldnt take a bobby pin and wave it I need to stop bein debated Youre still copyin Xeroxing Im still coppin a feel Like Bill Cosby at will popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jills coffee Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil wobbly and still groggy This blonde fucks reprehensible misconducts never sensible Kiss my butt my set of principles is gone But til I get the President to respond My pen and pencil is a missile launcher And send it to Mitch McConnell Just as big of a bitch as Donald Shits on bruh Let me sing this shit soprano While I do it pizzicato Ivanka stiff arm her While Im hittin on Melania And this songs for all ya  Cause nobody likes me everybody hates me They want me to go eat some worms I hope you offended And drag my name through the mud through the dirt But Ima make you eat your words I hope you offended You can try to hold me down but you better let me up Cause youre only gonna make things worse I hope you offended Cause I swear when I get up Im never gonna let up Til everybody eats my turds  These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery Goin ham at candy yam on nanny cam Im gettin handys with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest Im imagining objects so Im batting cobwebs From a daddy longleg And Hamtramck got the panoramic camera Xanax a banana hammock and a Santa hat Im smellin like a damn mechanic With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent Twice her age and Im actin half it Grow up Nah Not that I know of yall Basement just got a frickin overhaul got a stripper pole installed Started rollin all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin ball Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blowup doll of Rachel Dolezal Youre so appalled sos my manager Bitch Im amateur fuck a pro career Coast is clear but nowhere to go from here And nobodys close so dont compare They aint nowhere near Im way over here My competition cant see me Cause I dont own a mirror But Marshall you are terrific so smart and gifted Im so narcissistic when I fart I sniff it Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it Your anxietys throwin gang signs But I made strides with these rape lines Im cuttin back on women hate crimes Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes Bang bang bang bang time Dang knivesll butcher them gay wives Youre gonna need sutures the same size As the blade I push into captcha When I pull em like sleigh rides Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times To make it on Dateline I came to stake my claim like a canine Waitin in a buffet line So Kellyanne Conway Im a really bad hombre Come play belly dance on me Ive been making wedding plans all day  Cause nobody likes me everybody hates me They want me to go eat some worms I hope you offended And drag my name through the mud through the dirt But Ima make you eat your words I hope you offended You can try to hold me down but you better let me up Cause youre only gonna make things worse I hope you offended Cause I swear when I get up Im never gonna let up Til everybody eats my turds  Eight year old with the wordplay Girl take this pole like a survey Today wasnt my birthday But Im caked up like a dessert tray So were in shape Cause youre in a slurrin state Im a ten youre an eight like what I do before after and during rape You wanna get into a pissin contest and find out whos better And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him R Kelly with a full bladder Nonhigh school grad Im not a scholar But Im so cold when Im droppin knowledge my degrees Its the same as I got in college zero But nobodys hotter you owe me my respect I owe you nada like Haloti partner blow me Told you Im so dirty homie you can throw me in some holy water With some floaties on And get the soap and try to get the Pope to hold me While you hose me off And nope I wont be washed You hope to God I dont explode I gotta blow this spot up though I got a lotta more I wont put the sugar coating on it though Cause sometimes you can feel like your energys expired Raps got you drained dead tired zapped You feel like a wet pile of crap But look man like the feds buggin my phone uh huh I get why youre tapped But you gotta get your fire back Catch fire get upset and fire back Is what I tell myself When times get bad Cause sometimes I might get sad But I take the same advice I had And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when lifes a drag Told her to do like her dad dont cry get mad Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags Im hyper by the time you see this side of me Im right in your ass sodomy Fore the pen I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school at his school You aint have to have no money or go shoppin just to cop a fuckin attitude Now my doughs amountin to a mountain its rised too high to count it Never asked to be rich all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted But then I think about it and Im enraged Cause I just figured out that if I was paid For the time I spent to put the pen to the page Itd be minimum wage But its embedded in my head I never hunted for the bread and butter What I wanted was to be the one that they were scared of But Im never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I put up in the pen And when Im dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal Or forget I was ever this incredible I guess I better go harder than ever cause Ill never get Another motherfuckin opportunity again To offend as many people with this I can simply because I can  Cause nobody likes me everybody hates me They want me to go eat some worms I hope you offended And drag my name through the mud through the dirt But Ima make you eat your words I hope you offended You can try to hold me down but you better let me up Cause youre only gonna make things worse I hope you offended Cause I swear when I get up Im never gonna let up Til everybody eats my turds
