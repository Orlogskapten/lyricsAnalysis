Eminem,2005,Curtain Call: The Hits,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/singforthemoment.html,rap,These ideas are nightmares to white parents Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings Like whatever they say has no bearing its so scary in a house that allows no swearing To see him walking around with his headphones blaring Alone in his own zone cold and he dont care Hes a problem child What bothers him all comes out when he talks about His fuckin dad walkin out Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out If he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out His thoughts are whacked hes mad so hes talkin back Talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap He sags his pants dorags and a stocking cap His stepfather hit him so he socked him back and broke his nose His house is a broken home theres no control he just lets his emotions go  Come on Sing with me Sing sing for the year Sing it Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Come on Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  Entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy only have one homie Only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great Or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate Its like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen From standin on corners and porches just rappin To havin a fortune no more kissin ass But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you To get their hands on every dime you have they want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all they kids be listenin to me religiously so Im signin CDs while police fingerprint me Theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me If Im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense Pete Its all political if my music is literal and Im a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl I couldnt I wouldnt be fit to youre full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you  Come on Sing with me Sing sing for the year Sing it Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing that shit Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and Ill get sued See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols And they want to get one cause they think the shits cool Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves we entertainers Of course the shits affectin our sales you ignoramus But music is reflection of self we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail Its fucked up aint it How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted Thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs Or for anyone whos ever been through shit in their lives Till they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe Were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in their eyes Thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it squeeze it and hold it Cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe theyll admit it when were gone Just let our spirits live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can  Sing with me Sing sing for the year Sing it Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Come on Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  Sing with me Sing sing for the year Sing it Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Come on Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Eminem,2013,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/asshole.html,rap,iVerse 1i Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain An asshole that role think I succeeded fulfillin But dont think I ever stopped to think that I was speaking to children Everything was happenin so fast It was like I blinked sold 3 million Then it all went blank all I remember is feelin ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feelin Like Im always under attack man I coulda stacked my shit list to the ceilin Women dishin but really Thinkin if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him Guess Im a little bit of a hypocrite when Im rippin shit But since when did this many People ever give a shit what I had to say Its just my opinion If it contradicts how Im livin put a dick in your rearend Thats why every time you mention a lyric I thanked you for it for drawin more attention toward it Cause it gave me an enormous platform Im flattered you thought I was that important But you cant ignore the fact that I fought for the respect and battled for it Mad awards had GLAAD annoyed attaboy They told me to slow down Id just zoneout Good luck tryin to convince a blonde its like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out Cause I was trying to leave No Doubt In anyones mind one day Id go down in history think they know now Because everybody knows  iChorus  Skylar Greyi Everybody knows that youre just an asshole Everywhere that you go people want to go home everyone knows Everybody knows so dont pretend to be nice Theres no place you can hide you are just an asshole Everyone knows everyone knows Thanks for the support asshole i2xi  iVerse 2i Quit actin salty I was countin on you to count me out Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out Thought I was history well God damn honky that compliments like backhandin a donkey good way to get your ass socked in the mouth Nah Im off him but what the fucks all this trash talking about The fight was fixed Im back and you cant stop me you knocked me down I went down for the count I fell but the fans caught me and now Youre gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me to take my belt Word to Pacquiao mama said there aint nothing else to talk about Better go in that ring and knock em out or you better not come out Its poetry in motion like Freddie Roach when hes quotin Shakespeare so what if insults are revoltin Even Helen Keller knows life stinks You think its a joke till your bullet riddled but you should give little shit what I think This whole world is a mess gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman Who needs to test a testicles Not that man Half you dont got the guts intestinal blockage rest of you got lap bands Stuck to this motto fore they put bath salts in all those Water bottles in Colorado so get lost Waldo my souls escaping through this asshole that is gaping A black hole and Im swallowin this track whole better pack toilet paper But Im takin no crap hoe here I go down the Bat Pole and Im changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go tryin to dip out the back door retreating Cause everybody knows  iChorusi  iVerse 3i Holy mackerel Im the biggest jerk on the planet Earth I smacked a girl Off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull For thinkin we had some magnetic pull Then screamed quotICP in this bitch How do fuckin magnets workquot Cause youre attractive but we aint attractable hate to be dramatical but Im not romantical Im makin up words so you can understandable Its tragical thinkin some magical shits gonna happen that aint practical You crackin a joke Its laughable Cause me and loves like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault so its safe to say Im uncrackable My heart is truly guarded Full body armor bitch you just need a helmet cause if you think you special youre retarded Thinkin youre one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina Youre a trainwreck I got a onetrack mind and shorty youre fine but you sorta remind me of a 49er Cause youve been a gold digger since you was a miner Been tryin to hunt me down like a dog cause youre on my ass but you cant get a cent Cause all of my spare times spent On my nose in this binder so dont bother tryin Only women that I love are my daughters but sometimes I rhyme And it sounds like I forget Im a father and I push it farther so Father forgive me if I forget to draw the line Its apparent I shouldnt have been parent Ill never grow up so to Hell with your parents and mother fuck father time It aint never gonna stop a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime So even if Im halfdead Im half alive Poured my halfempty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over And Im about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster Im goin back to what got me here yeah cocky and Cant knock bein Rudolph so fear not my deer And dry up your tear drops Im here White Americas mirror so dont feel awkward or weird If you stare at me and see yourself cause youre one too shouldnt be a shock be Cause everybody knows  iChorusi

Eminem,2013,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/badguy.html,rap,iEminemi Its like Im in this dirt digging up old hurt Tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work All it takes is one song on the radio youre right back on it Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off And left me so burnt spent a lot of time trying to soul search Maybe I needed to grow up a little first Well looks like I hit a growth spurt But I am coming for closure Dont suppose an explanation Im owed for The way that you turned your back on me Just when I may have needed you most Oh you thought it was over You could just close the chapter And go about your life like it was nothing You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine Well Ive never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha Bout to go throughs tougher than anything I ever have suffered Cant think of a better way to define poetic justice Can I hold grudges mind saying quotLet it go fuck thisquot Hearts saying quotI will once I bury this bitch alive Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunsetquot  iSarah Jaffei I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth But its easier to justify Whats bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy  iEminemi And to think I used to think you was the shit bitch To think it was you at one time I worshiped shit Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it Not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew sic knit wit Thought some time had past and Id forget it forget it You left our family in shambles You expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed May be gone but hes not forgotten And dont think cause hes been out the picture so long That Ive stopped the plottin and still aint coming to get ya Youre wrong and that shit was rotten And the way you played him same shit you did to me cold Have you any idea the shit that Ive gone through Feelings I harbor all this pentup resentment I hold on to Not once you call to ask me how Im doing Letters you dont respond to em Fuck it Im coming to see you And gee who better to talk to than you The cause of my problems My life is garbage and Im bout to take it out on you Poof then Im gone voosh And  iSarah Jaffei I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth But its easier to justify Whats bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy  iEminemi Ive been driving around your side of this town Like 9 frickin hours and 45 minutes now Finally I found your new address park in your drive Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life And its now arrived and my mouth is fulla saliva My knife is out and Im ducking on the side of your house See its sad it came to this point Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya But I aint here for ya empathy I dont need your apology Or your friendship or sympathy its revenge that I seek So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window Like I reach my full potentialâI peeked Continue to peep still bent low Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo Sneak all the way round to the back porch Man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this You dont plan for intruders beforehand Surprised to see me Cat got your tongue Gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung Like you picked an axe up and swung Stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk By one of your fans ironys spectacular huh Now whos a faggot you punk And heres your Bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck Its just me you and the music now Slim I hope you hear it were in a car right now Wait here comes my favorite lyric Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die And hey heres a sequel to my Mathers LP Just to try to get people to buy Well hows this for publicity stunt This should be fun Last album now cause after this youll be officially done Eminem killed by M and M Matthew Mitchell bitch I even have your initials I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it Since youre in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here Two more exits time is quite near I hope we dont get stopped no license I fear That sirens I hear Guess 90 on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea As cops appear in my drivers side mirror Oh God police Ah Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least New plan Stan Slim quotchauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln town carquot Well gotta go almost at the bridge haha big bro its for you Slim this is for him and Frank Ocean hope you can swim good Now say you hate homos again  iEminemi I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend Im the nightmare you fell asleep in and then woke up still in Im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin Nope its hopeless Im the denial that youre hopelessly in When they say all of this is approaching its end But you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again Backs to the wall Im stacking up all them odds toilets clogged Yeah cause Im talking a lotta shit but Im backing it all up But in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers After the track is demolished quotI am your lack of a consciencequot Im the ringing in your ears Im the polyps on the back of your tonsils Eating your vocal chords after your concerts Im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged Grab for some water but Im that pill thats too jagged to swallow Im the bullies you hate that you became With every faggot you slaughtered Coming back on you every woman you insult batter But the doublestandards you have when it comes to your daughters I represent everything you take for granted Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers personas half a faÃade and Matthew and Stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had til its gone Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name Cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them Im the hindsight to say quotI told you soquot Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow Im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow If you dont stop after they call you Biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits When its time to walk away Im every guilt trip the baggage you have But as you gather up all your possessions If theres anything you have left to say Unless it makes an impact then dont bother So before you rest your case Better make sure youre packing a wallop So one last time Im back Before it fades into black and its all over Behold the final chapter in the saga Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle Twice the magic that started it all Tragic portrait of an artist tortured Trapped in his own drawings Tap into thoughts Blacker and darker than anything imaginable Here goes a wild stab in the dark As we pick up where the last Mathers left off

Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me Paul wants me to chill yall want me to ill I should eat a pill probably I will Old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death I breathe on the mirror I dont see my breath Possibly Im dead I must be possessed Like an evil spell Im EVIL evil but spelled  Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick Stick it in a vice grip hang it on a spike fence Bang it with a pipe wrench While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch Like vicepresident Mike Pence Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip  These are things that Id rather do than hear you on a mic Since ninetenths of your rhyme is about ice and Jesus Christ man how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch Fuck my side chick  You wont ever see Em icy but as cold as I get on the MIC I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick yeah  Turn down for what I aint loud enough Nah turn the valium up Cause I dont know how Im gonna get your mouths to shut Now when it doesnt matter what caliber I spit at Ill bet a hundred thousand bucks Youll turn around and just be like quotMan how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just cause his album sucks And now he wants to take it out on usquot oohooh  But last week an exfan mailed me a copy Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study Itll help me get back to myself and shell love me oohooh I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that Id just be like everyone else in the fucking industry Especially an effing Recovery clone of me  So fingerbang chicken wang MGK Igg Azae Lil Pump Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne I should aim at everybody in the game pick a name Im fed up with being humble And rumor is Im hungry Im sure you heard bumblings I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach I heard your mumblin but its jumbled in mumbojumbo The era that Im from will pummel you Thats what its comin to What the fuck youre gonna do when you run into it Im gonna crumble you and Ill take a number two And dump on you if you aint Joyner If you aint Kendrick or Cole or Sean then youre a goner Im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonalds But if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival But yall are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider Maybe the vocals should have been autotuned And you would have bought it But sayin I no longer got it Cause you missed a lot and never caught it Cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it Cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest With your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist And Im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless What Ill never be is flawless all Ill ever be is honest Even when Im gone theyre gonna say I brought it Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic With a bottle full of malt liquor But I couldnt bottle this shit any longer The fact that I know that Ima hit my bottom If I dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet I dont see why yall even started with me I get in beefs my enemies die I dont cease fire til at least all are deceased Im east side never be caught slippin Now you see why I dont sleep Not even a wink I dont blink I dont doze off I dont even nod to the beats I dont even close my fuckin eyes when I sneeze  quotAw man That BET cypher was weak it was garbage The Thing aint even orangeâoh my God thats a reachquot Shout to all my colorblind people each and every one of yall If you call a fire engine green aquamarine Or you think water is pink quotDawg thats a datequot quotLooks like an olive to mequot quotLook theres an applequot quotNo its not its a peachquot  So fingerbang Pootie Tang Burger King Gucci Gang dookie dang Charlamagne gonna hate anyway Doesnt matter what I say Give me Donkey of the Day What a way for 2018 to get underway But Im gonna say everything that I wanna say Welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah Invite them in like a One A Day Im not done preach Cause I feel like the beast of burden That line in the sand was it even worth it Cause the way I see people turnings Is makin it seem worthless Its startin to defeat the purpose Im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds And I was just tryin to do the right thing but word Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict Or still yet to be determined Cause Im determined to be me critiqued or worshiped But if I could go back Id at least reword it And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent Sold the dream to that hes deserted  But I think its workin These verses are makin him a wee bit nervous And hes too scurred to answer me with words Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered But I know at least hes heard it Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin him Or ask if Im linked to terrorists I said quotOnly when it comes to ink and lyricistsquot But my beef is more media journalists Hold up hold up hold upâ I said my beef is more meaty a journalist Can get a mouthful of flesh And yes I mean eating a penis Cause they been pannin my album to death So I been givin the media fingers Dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh But they been puttin me through the ringer So I aint ironin shit out with the press But I just took this beat to the cleaners

minutes six minutes Somethings wrong I can feel it Six minutes six minutes Slim Shady youre on Just a feeling Ive got Like somethings about to happen But I dont know what If that means what I think it

got a laptop in my back pocket My penll go off when I halfcock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a living and a killing off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack Im an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables skillaholic Kill em all with This flippity dippityhippity hiphop You dont really wanna get into a pissing match With this rappity brat Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac Backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicing that Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow All I do is drop quotFquot bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are having a rough time period Heres a maxi pad Its actually disastrously bad For the wack while Im masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah  Cause Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box Let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard  Everybody want the key and the secret to rap Immortality like I have got Well to be truthful the blueprints Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew MCs get taken to school with this music Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme Now I lead a new school full of students Me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz 2Pac NWA Cube hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up Blow up and be in a position To meet RunDMC and induct them Into the motherfuckin Rock n Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church And burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You fags think its all a game Til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking Little gaylooking boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy Youre witnessing a massoccur like youre watching a church gathering take place looking boy Oy vey that boys gay Thats all they say looking boy You get a thumbs up

Never asked nobody for shit Get outta my face looking boy Basically boy youre never gonna be capable Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy cause  Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod The way Im racing around the track call me NASCAR NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod this planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard  So youll be Thor and Ill be Odin Youre rodent Im omnipotent Let off then Im reloading Immediately with these bombs Im totin And I should not be woken Im the walking dead But Im just a talking head a zombie floating But I got your mom deepthroating Im out my Ramen Noodle We have nothing in common poodle Im a Doberman pinch yourself In the arm and pay homage pupil Its me My honestys brutal But its honestly futile if I dont utilize What I do though for good At least once in a while so I wanna make sure Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle Enough rhymes to Maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes But sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come trying to Censor you like that one line I said On quotIm Backquot from The Mathers LP One when I tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine Put em all in a line Add an AK47 a revolver and a nine See if I get away with it now That I aint as big as I was but Im Morphin into an immortal coming through the portal Youre stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for Youre pointless as Rapunzel With fucking cornrows You write normal Fuck being normal And I just bought a new ray gun from the future Just to come and shoot ya Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a fag At Mayweathers pad singin to a man While he played piano Man oh man that was a 247 special On the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day quotHey Fab Imma kill youquot Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed JJ Fad Uh summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is Ricocheting off of me and itll glue to you Im devastating more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know that haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music You make elevator music quotOh hes too mainstreamquot Well thats what they do When they get jealous they confuse it quotIts not hiphop its popquot Cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on quotLose Yourselfquot and make em lose it quotI dont know how to make songs like that I dont know what words to usequot Let me know when it occurs to you While Im ripping any one of these verses that versus you Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to Unghh school flunky pill junky But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself but still hungry I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to When Im a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues But its still tongueincheek fuck you Im drunk So Satan take the fucking wheel Im asleep in the front seat Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz Still quotChunky but Funkyquot But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and Heres what they want from me Theyre asking me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it Lifes handing you lemons Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then Dont mistake him for Satan Its a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas And take a vacation to trip a broad And make her fall on her face and Dont be a retard be a king Think not Why be a king when you can be a God
