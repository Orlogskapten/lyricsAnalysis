Eminem,1999,Slim Shady LP,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/badmeetsevil.html,rap,iIntro  Cowboy Jeff Bassi I reckon you aint familiar with these here parts You know theres a story behind that there saloon Twenty years ago two outlaws took this whole town over Sheriffs couldnt stop em Quickest damn gunslingers Ive ever seen Got murdered in coldblood That old saloon there was their little quothome away from homequot They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern And on a quiet night You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 59quot  iEminemi I dont speak I float in the air wrapped in a sheet Im not a real person Im a ghost trapped in a beat I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph And a noise is spread picked up and transmitted through Royces head Trap him in his room possess him and hoist his bed Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead Told him each one of his boys is dead I asked him to come to the dark side He made a choice and said  iRoycei Who hard Yo I done heard worse We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other To see which onell swerve first Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds That of a globe on top of nine other planets Kissed the cheek of the Devil Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto Dismissal Im not a fair man Disgraced the race of an atheist Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot One track sliced without swords I buried the Christ corpse In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse And stay overworked its like the Nazis and the Nation Collaborating attempting to take over the Earth  iEminemi Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees til we look like Vietnamese people Hes Evil and Im Bad like Steve Seagal Above the law cause I dont agree with police either Shit me neither We aint eager to be legal So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle I breathe ether in three lethal amounts While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain Hes insane No Im not I just want to shoot up and Im pissed off Cause I cant find a decent vein  iRoycei The disaster with dreads Im bad enough to commit suicide And survive long enough to kill my soul after Im dead When in danger its funny actually my flavors similar to a waiter Cause I serve any stranger with money I spray a hundred man until they joint chains While slipping bullets at pointblank range like they was punches Piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it Whipping human ass throwing blows cracking jaws With my fists wrapped in gauze dipped in glue and glass Im blazing MCs at the same time amazing MCs Somehow MCs aint that eyebrowraising to me From all of angles of us flash a Mack loud enough To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt  iInterludei iphone ringsi Hello Billy Aiyyo whats up were comin to get you STOP THEY KNOW ITS US  iEminemi I used to be a loudmouth remember me Im the one who burned your house down well Im out now And this time Im coming back to blow your house up And I aint gon leave you a window to jump out of Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms And you wont see me like fat people in steam rooms And when I go to hell and Im getting ready to leave Ima put air in a bag and charge people to breathe  iRoyce and Eminemi Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees til we look like Vietnamese people Hes Evil and Im Bad like Steve Seagal Against peaceful see you in hell for the sequel Well be waiting See you in hell Wall Street Royce Da 59quot Slim Shady See you in hell for the sequel byebye Bad Meets Evil what til next time  iCowboyi And so thats the story when Bad meets Evil Two of the most wanted individuals in the county Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like lawabiding citizens Its too bad they had to go out the way they did Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon But their spirits still live on till this day Shhhispitsi wait did yall hear that iFootsteps and windblowingi

Eminem,2013,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/groundhogday.html,rap,What is a nightmare The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare  I used to think I had bad luck but I wasnt superstitious Til one day I grew suspicious when I stepped on a crack on Aunt Ednas stoop And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new beditching Missouri for Michigan didnt work So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan from Missouri back to Michigan Someone put me out my misery I cant do this again Mom please stick to a decision Discipline last thing I wanna do is listen shes like Lex Luthor bitch her rules are Kryptonite So the walls and I done lost my power to see through them bitches But I run into them running through the kitchen Pretending to be blind Superman Cause I had no supervision But I did have a super power though I could turn into Invisible Kid Disappear out of sight like a true magician And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different Music into the picture and it became my new religion quotI remember it clearly even todayquot Move back to Michigan again to live with my Grandma Nan Always itchin for something to do was flipping Through the radio stations one day And discovered this DJ who was mixing I say it to this day if you aint listened to the wizard You aint have a fucking clue what you was missing Id zone out with my headphones all I remember doings wishing For shoes fuck them stupid Pumas bitch its all about them new edition Troops You get the new LL Cool J cooling system Made that final maneuver to 8 Mile and Hoover and somehow I saw my future is in this Thats how I knew my mission Little boom box boomin spitting Practicing numerous rhythms When I sit in my room envisioning My dreams come to fruition I remember Proof would visit Couldnt wait to play him my new shit hed go cuckoo ballistic Go through the roof for his shit Its like we knew the instant We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit Never quit too persistent quotWe are the underground empirequot  Started a group of misfits Proof had a proposition If we all band together there aint no stopping this shit Come up with aliases bipolar opposites and Be ready to come off the top as sharp position If you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slippin Theyd take your spot if someone got to rippin you And you forgot your written Opportunity knocks once it aint knocking again They tried dingdong ditching shit I fucking got that bitch in a headlock Cut off his oxygen Slim snot gourgin Cock sucking cynder block in the wind Now I got my pot to piss in Spot in that top position Copping over the opposition Looking like a dog thats pissing Leg up on the competition Promising complete dominance Sugar Ray Robinson Im in a league Muhammads in Alis my colleague bombing them Probably end up on top of them Stomping them like Ndamukong Im Russian like a Ukrainian LaDainian Tomlinson Flow vomits in your face Competitors fall at my waist You spit a rhyme I spit in a rhymes face So name the time place to battle Bitch Im still in that mind state Dont make me step on you and make you wine grapes Cry babies maybe my way that I use words is loose But you turds better be careful how you choose yours Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse And the truth hurts shit no wonder youre sore losers Now wheres your poop birds Ooh no more tripping in bird shit songs of selfempowerment surging Words of encouragement but this discouraging the rappers The rap games God but the names not James Todd Im just a wordsmith So let these words lift Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells since yours aint working out Each verse is more merciless than the first is And you aint got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served Blood thirst Revenge of the Nerds Chickit  quotAnd its true that youll not escape my vengeancequot  And Im the kid with them ears like Dumbos gone Word to Uncle Ron Im turning into a nonhumble Don You blonde dumb hoes all I got is dick for you to come blow on So start the show but I need a drum roll fore I go on Better back away from the front row get launched Show you Im bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo On the fuckin Jumbotron Im a juggernaut you do not wanna rumble you bomboclaat Ill leave you stretched out like a fucking yawn So mow the fucking lawn your asses are blades of grass And Im fucking up this whole landscape of rap The GOAT just ate eight acres An eighth of that was just to make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper Oh look my notebook looks smokecooked Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove soot Charred debris floating Like oak wood was burning Return of the no good And I wont quit  quotAnd the next thing I know something came crawling up from below Something that made Godzilla look like a planequot  And I dont quit wont change Its like a Groundhogs Day So crowd around yall cause you may See if I popped your head  quotIm a heartless monsterquot Turn me into quotIm a heartless monsterquot quotWith my dick in your mouth all dayquot  Im not so sure I want to know from whence it came But the white flesh creatures trail is easily followed There before that shimmering veil of light the ivory skin slug thing

face and said not to talk But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off But Bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka You couldnt even take him to Dres to get Bob a quotDrquot He grabbed Stace by the legs as chopped it off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander

Eminem,2013,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/wickedways.html,rap,iHook  X Ambassadorsi Im getting by with my wicked ways Im loading up and Im taking names I wanna dig my way to hell I wanna dig my way to hell  iVerse 1  Eminemi Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder Ever heard of Aspergers Its a rare condition Its what youre suffering from When you simply dont care if its an 80 degree day and theres no fricken air conditioning And you cant see the bitchâs hair is frizzing Cause you got the windows up Blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prizm The devil aint on a level same as him Picture someone who revels in straight masochism And imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping So bad they should put his ass in prison A word bully I verbally abuse verbs Like they did something to me personally Used to get bullied so Id cut class and ditch it Now I bully rap Im the shit faggot sniff it Cadillac from a K Car My ass from a hole in the ground still canât tell em apart Came straight out the trailer park screaming Im proud To shop at KMart and it became art And Im still fed up and as pissed off as they are To this day I still get in fights with the same broad At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart In the middle of the aisle whilin I dont give a fuck I dont play Bitch you think you saw this basket first Youre ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay Illest shit you could think I would say Minds like a pile of clay Whens the last time that you saw a villain with a cape Ripped a gaping hole in it Flipped out ripped down the drapes Tied em around my neck Went down the fire escape of the Empire State Slipped fell straight down to the ground Splattered all over the entire state And straight to hell got impaled by the gates Saw Satan stuck his face in an ashtray While I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face And this aint got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot But by the way thoughts are getting darker by the day Im a combination of Skylar Grey Tyler the Creator and Violent J Its a fuckin miracle to be this lyrical Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face Im insane Every rhyme I say sons you like an ultra violet ray Iâm selling hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat 1199 so come on and pile a plate Iâm throwin down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise With the rhyme Iâm spittin while Iâm shittin on competition In the meantime itâs always mean time  iHooki  iVerse 2  Eminemi Iâve been a career asshole I donât see why these people always got my back I done said so much fucked up shit I was born a mistake But I was put here not by accident I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish Slaughter tracks I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit Iâm coming to get that quarter back Like Ndamukong the drama can build Your mama can ask me for my autograph Cause that cougars a MILF shes the oldest trick in the book But I sure would fall for that You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight When I get on the mic Imma snap Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital When I overdosed woulda caught a flat If it makes you sick to your stomach acid Indigestion my suggestionâs Kaopectate If it feels like Im running away with the game Its cause I am dont speculate spectate All I got is dick for days and insults for decades But I get by with my wicked ways Lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches Cry til you get puffy eyes red faced But Im leaving on this jet plane You aint fly youre an airhead And Im sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole sorry another catchphrase But your baggage aint gonna fit in my storage overhead space Cause it just aint big enough to fit your damaged goods Other words dont try to put your heart in a headcase Cause baby stable mentally I aint I need my meds I peed my bed Im going blind I dont see my legs I keep on falling down no wonder you cant stand me I need my cane Someone help me I think my face is melting If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain This GIANT hole in my empty head If you read my mind you can see my pain And youd see why I be this way Ever since I was knee high playin with GI Joes Told these hoes shut their PIE holes now peep my game Cause Im bout it bout it Like a like a fucking fucking Echo echo Psych Psycho on a cyclone cycle Spiraling here I go Im outta control like no Other mic go stab you til the knife goes  dull Im nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes Coz Imma sock it to you Dyke ho you dont like it Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle And ride it like a motorbike Im finna blow the mic the whole night so Strike up the fucking maestro Im nitro And hi ho hand me my shovel Im liable to dig my hole Deeper and its off to HE double hockey sticks I go  iHooki  iOutro  Eminem amp Ken Kaniffi Ohh please be empty please be empty please be empty Thank you God iBathroom door opening someone walks ini Shit iSounds of pissing and crappingi Is that a girl iKen Kaniff singingi Im gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth And get my balls blew out and get gay into the AM And lay with 18 guys naked and let myself show let myself show  Why do I know that voice Buttfuck it suck it pull it tug it Lifes too short to not stroke your bone  Are you fucking serious So everybody everybody Circle jerk touch my body iDoors slam screamingi Who is that Where are you going Come back Why does everyone always leave me Hello Fuck you then iLoud crapping noisei Blow it out your ass

Eminem,2013,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/baby.html,rap,ibaby cryingi  One thousand different houses and MÃ¼nchhausen Imma make you wanna punch out somefuckingone quotOuchquot What the fuckd you hit me for Scream quotlifequot as I punch counter and bunches out of anger I once encountered a stranger In a dumb gown black hood With a scythe Shit I laughed in his face spit Bitch gave me an extra life like quotTake thisquot Now get your ass back in that game bitch Dont take shit for granted And dont take shit give it Only bull you should take is by the horns A mixture of Whitey Ford and Mighty Thor I everlast pen is mightier than sword Finish writing then record Replenish keep writing more Nothings riding on it but your pride is all youre fighting for So you fight scratch you claw Backs to wall No one was there to catch you fall You pick yourself back up you dust your jacket off You grab your balls like theyre gargantuan and Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it Pull out your pass for whooping ass and flash it on em Nobodys gonna back you in the corner Youre a hornet No ones more ignorant Than you fuckin four in the morning Youre at the laboratory storming Like theres nothing thats more important MCs you better consider this a formal warning Youre in for it Girl what would you do if I said your body was off the chain And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face I aint finished bitch I meant in half oil the blades Nobody wants to play They say Im a spoiled little baby But  Nobody puts baby in the corner Im only tryna warn ya Cause that baby gets mad And gets to throwing a tantrum Hell fucking flip on ya Cause nobody puts baby in the corner Im only tryna warn ya Cause that baby gets mad And gets to throwing a tantrum Hell fucking flip on ya  What goes through an addicts brain Besides static pain and Big Daddy Kane Breakbeats and words An erratic train of thought Like splatter paint Scatterbrained Yeah maybe that explains Why youre back but dont rap the same And youre looking way thinner Cause your hunger got you looking like They took away dinner chooka quotSugar Rayquot Leonard wouldnt sugarcoat a fucking booger though Just to wipe that bitch on a hookers coat When you say youre a chooka what chooka what Now fling that bitch from your fingertips Hope it lands on another rap singers lips Who cant think of shit Anything of wit thats interesting to spit Whos king of this fucking English Lit Let your middle fingers flip on each hand While extending this shit How low can you go Lower than Chuck D ho Hear the bassiness in my voice Rockys back wheres my Adrian Nobodys crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius Im what Tom Brady is to the patriots to rap Not a man Im a weapon Who just happened to be a rapper Who just happen to be on the crapper When it happened I had an epiphany In the bathroom Id never be the same after Now Im back with an appetite For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster So lets eat cause Im famished Every deed is a dastardly one Evilish bastard even you askin for me to be polite To peoples like me havin my teeth pulled  Nobody puts baby in the corner Im only tryna warn ya Cause that baby gets mad And gets to throwing a tantrum Hell fucking flip on ya Cause nobody puts baby in the corner Im only tryna warn ya Cause that baby gets mad And gets to throwing a tantrum Hell fucking flip on ya  So step inside a dimension The demented side of a mind Thats like an inside of an engine While I multiply your undivided attention But be reminded if I didnt mention I lose my mind and my temper Youll be the first one Who finds him offensive Got him climbing the fences Lost some time to addiction But look up rhyme in the dictionary Im in the picture Eminem is the synonym for it Im an enigma Fuck it lets get to the meat balls Im gonna skip the veg and potatoes Edumacator they are Shit legends are made of Spit treacherous data Shit that you would say to your worst enemy This wretched is What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada Then combine em with Method Man and Redman With methamphetamines in his left hand And in his right theres a sledgehammer In pajamas standing in front of a webcam Beating himself in the head til Russell lets him off Def Jam Maybe I need my head examined Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan I need meds Swear to god cause If I go off the edge TI aint talking me off a ledge man Heart throb at a fart ah nah More like a smart slob part blob Thatll stab you with a sharp object To the heart and leave claw marks All over the WalMart walls Little baby with large balls Fuck mud slinging Im blood flinging Theres nothing on this fucking Earth better than being The king of the playground I hate the swings but I love being an underdog Cause when Im pushed I end up swinging up  Nobody puts baby in the corner Im only tryna warn ya Cause that baby gets mad And gets to throwing a tantrum Hell fucking flip on ya Cause nobody puts baby in the corner Im only tryna warn ya Cause that baby gets mad And gets to throwing a tantrum Hell fucking flip on ya

Motionless in White,2014,Reincarnate,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/motionlessinwhite/contemptress.html,Rock\Alternatif,In darkness youre all around me I know our future I feel your body  What if I told you that I planned this What if I want to lose control What if I take the blame become the drug dissolve as you swallow  Covered in your silhouette Elated for your bitter end Dont hide the shame from our lips Glowing in amber burn in sin  Against the wall we fall from grace The pain we love is taking shape A burning lust to touch the flame Over and over again  Weve played this role a thousand times The same old script just different lies You disappear without a trace Concealing the crimes on your face  Beneath all the pleasure all you are is pain And you deserve every second of your suffering But yet I cant stop crawling to your doorstep Every time you beckon Im self destructing trust in nothing Save me  You burn like a cigarette I took my time to suck you in So take me out of my head And spread your ashes on my skin  Against the wall we fall from grace The pain we love is taking shape A burning lust to touch the flame Over and over again  Weâve played this role a thousand times The same old script just different lies You disappear without a trace Concealing the crimes on your face  Fall  Your skin like winter I felt you shiver I heard you whisper but the pills were quicker I watched you wither I am the killer  Against the wall we fall from grace The pain we love is taking shape A burning lust to touch the flame Over and over again We beg like dirt and flesh disarms We built it up to fall apart Even the quothonestyquot was fake Concealing the crimes on your face   
Billie Eilish,2019,"When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?",https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billieeilish/allthegoodgirlsgotohell.html,pop,My Lucifer is lonely  Standing there killing time Cant commit to anything but a crime Peters on vacation an open invitation Animals evidence Pearly gates look more like a picket fence Once you get inside em Got friends but cant invite them  Hills burn in California My turn to ignore ya Dont say I didnt warn ya  All the good girls go to hell Cause even God herself has enemies And once the water starts to rise And Heavens out of sight Shell want the Devil on her team  My Lucifer is lonely  Look at you needing me You know Im not your friend without some greenery Walk in wearing fetters Peter should know better Your cover up is caving in Man is such a fool Why are we saving him Poisoning themselves now Begging for our help wow  Hills burn in California My turn to ignore ya Dont say I didnt warn ya  All the good girls go to hell Cause even God herself has enemies And once the water starts to rise And Heavens out of sight Shell want the Devil on her team  My Lucifer is lonely Theres nothing left to save now My God is gonna owe me Theres nothing left to save now  I cannot do this snowflake
