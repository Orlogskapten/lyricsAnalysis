and a guard They need some coffee everybodyâs sleeping on me Going around door to door setting off alarms All that horse shit you should have left it at the barn Keep a stallion tell her gallop to the store and get cigars yeah Too many whips gotta get a new garage made I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase Me and my bizarre ways no emergency I moved up from a Private to a Sargent You can see it in the scar face Hidden in a dark place swimming in the shark tank Give a bitch a little bit of change she a game in an arcade Time crisis Not a second to lose Iâm the motherfuckin Bible thatâs forever the truth And this is not another case of the celebrity blues The devil with me and he tell me to shoot  Murder murder murder what would you do Have you ever had to hurt her Just for something to do Can you draw a perfect circle Lot of lies cover the truth you got options what do you do I wash these pills down with liquor and fall Leave it to me I do enough for us all I do Got what you need if you like breaking the law My mother raised me a God Hey Fuck you  Yeah blame the drugs got me sinning on the weekday Drunk as fuck doing buck sixty on the freeway Giving yall the freebase hidden in the middle of a briefcase Hidden in a subwoofer beat case Used to wanna know how a freak taste Now Iâm in it in an instant like replay Braâs a baton pass it off like relay Why Iâm so mad on my BDay She say âI thought you got soberâ And I say âI wish youâd stop being a bitch And get to minding your businessâ Told me âMoney has changed youâ I get to thinking how rarely do I visit Howâd I get so egotistical Iâm a Buffalo Soldier Heaven is a mile away the trouble much closer Iâm only twentythree but my mind is older and itâll forever be Dead presidents to the homies death to my enemies  Murder murder murder what would you do Have you ever had to hurt her Just for something to do Can you draw a perfect circle Lot of lies cover the truth you got options what do you do I wash these pills down with liquor and fall Leave it to me I do enough for us all Got what you need if you like breaking the law My mother raised me a God Hey Fuck you  A goddess told me âgood morningâ when I woke up Fuck you You know I had a good morning when I woke up Fuck you Gotta thank God every morning then I woke up Fuck you Would you remember me if I never woke up Bye bye Fuck you I am a sinner

her in a cab by now But Iâm stressing I canât relax I swallow my pride and Iâm higher than whatâs making me mad Everybody say I need rehab Cause Iâm speedin with a blindfold on and wonât be long âtil they watching me crash And they donât wanna see that They donât want me to OD and have to talk to my mother Telling her they could have done more to help me and sheâll be crying saying that sheâll do anything to have me back All the nights Iâm losing sleep it was all a dream there was a time that I believed that But white lines be numbing them dark times Them pills that Iâm popping I need to man up Itâs a problem I need a wake up Before one morning I donât wake up You make your mistakes your mistakes never make ya Iâm too obsessed with going down as a great one And if you wait too long they go find someone to replace ya So I guess this is a letter to all my brothers Most Dope thatâs forever And this the part that Q start crying if he ainât already yet I did my best to be a leader you respect At times I became weaker got defeated by regret So tell my baby I love her And if she give me time Iâll put a seed inside her make her a mother Just know that thereâs a place Where all my people free and everybody straight Every devil donât got horns and every hero donât got capes Opened up my eyes shit Iâm finally awake Good morning Yeah good morning  Yo man itâs the morning you gotta go to work âalrightâ Yo you gotta be at work in like ten minutes yo You good âIâm straight yo whatâs goodâ when you going You gotta pick up the dry cleaning and shit still âman fuck that shit Iâll

its no use We aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through  Black boy black boy we aint gonna lie to you Black boy black boy we dont like the sight of you Pull up on the side of you Window rolled down profile Then we wonder why we see this side of you Probably comin from the dope house We could let you slide but your tail light is blew out We know youre hidin that Heidi Klum On you another drug charge homie its back inside for you And just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true Pistol drew right at you wed be delighted to unload it In your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you Fucked up but what the fuck am I to do I keep tellin myself keep doin like youre doin No matter how many lives you ruin Its for the red white and blue Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two No ones ever indicted you Why Cause youre a  iEminem Cheech and Chongi White boy white boy youre a rockstar My momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live White boy white boy in your cop car But I dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve White boy white boy youre untouchable The worlds coming to an end I dont even care Nobody can tell me shit cause Im a big rockstar  iEminemi Black boy black boy we dont get your culture and We dont care what our governments done to fuck you over man Dont tell us your attitudes a result of that Balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at Why you kicking that soda can Pull your pants up we bout to roll up and Throw your ass in the van cuffed You dont have to know our plans or what our intentions are Our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands And put our minds more at ease Or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy Were fightin a crime war here come the swine Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities Thats what we call em pigsties for Theyre like eyesores to police Talk to you like just a piece of trash Feels like were stuck in a time warp to me As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions As this beat backspins its like were drifting back in To the sixties having black skin is risky Cause this keeps happening Throughout history AfricanAmericans have been treated like shit And I admit there have been times where its been embarrassin to be a  iEminem Cheech and Chongi White boy white boy youre a rockstar My momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live White boy white boy in your cop car But I dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve White boy white boy youre untouchable The worlds coming to an end I dont even care Nobody can tell me shit cause Im a big rockstar  iEminemi Seems like the average lifespan of a white man Is more than twice than a black life span I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner I feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance Id rather hear em say quotDie Nwordquot than Die Antwoord Ninja now its better disguised banter But thats life strapped cause were strapped financially And cant find answers Were applying but McDonalds Seems to be the only franchise thatll hire So how can we have higher standards As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter We fight back with violence but acts like that are Black eyes on the movement Which makes black lives madder At cops and cops madder Thats why its at a stalemate Cant arrive at a compromise so its Black Ops I wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops The block is our backyards officers not the crack spot Call the attack dogs off of us man You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop Sendin white cops in the black neighborhoods Who aint acclimated to em like thats the way to do it Who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns And know nobody black so they act afraid of us And thats racism the fear that a black face gives em A subconscious racist Wait why are there black neighborhoods Cause America segregated us designated us to an area Separated us SectionEightd us When we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us And education sucks and every days another Freddie Gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz Why is it they treat us like dryer lint We just want a safe environment for our kids But cant escape the sirens Dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in The poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in The lowest classes its like a razor wire fence And were trapped in these racial biases That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise Every time we see a devils face Lions tigers and bears oh my Its more like billy clubs and gats And we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black quotBut you kill each other facts You peel each others caps for silly stuff like hatsquot Single mother strugglin through substance abuse While people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes Fuck your Republican views Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots And streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics Or be that into characters just to see that just to be black You better be strapped with a derringer Or be quotcapped in Americaquot like Steve Rogers Cause no one oversees these cops and All we see is em beat charges We done seen em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off So we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings Just keep marchin til we reach congress But theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance If you try to slander the flag but Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum If you dont stand for the national anthem We raise it you better praise it Or youll be made to feel like a traitor well Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield Home of the brave is still racist ville So this whole nation feels like a plantation field In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals That had its Natives killed Got you singin this starspangled spiel To a piece of cloth that represents the quotLand of the Freequot that made people slaves to build
