seem cringy as fuck but actually do it Now Focus  I wanna say something I wanna talk to you but I dont even know what to say I feel like theres a truth that we all dont know And I think weve been designed To just do what we have II think we got more than five senses I think we got more than five senses But were never gonna find out any of the senses Because were so fuckin busy so wrapped up So caught up in what we are actually doing every single day Like think when someone discovered fire What the fuck would that have looked like How So theres fire right Do we reckon weve just discovered everything there is to discover Focus focus  The universe is full of surprises Its just waitin for us Just waitin for our wits to get sharper Just waitin for us to actually open Mad as fuck when you think about it Because it dont make sense does it I might sound like a proper idiot but like Try and figure out how anything actually works How we got here dont make any sense so Its not going Theres no way Its a little bit scarier Feel like a little bit like something that pops off Im just tired I guess Focus focus Focus focus on whatever you want Whatever you want you can have Cause I was literally the biggest loser in the world ADHD I had no friends I literally literally Im not even saying that like like a cliche thing I had literally no world I would hang out with My friends used to just tell me one time it would stop Mates used to nick all my money off me All my video games that shit PlayStation TVs and shit And I got bullied to fuck My life was shit And I have no idea how I managed to do something Where I actually get to do things that I like And live a life where Im happy But I know it wasnt from school I didnt learn fuckin shit from school I dont know anything I dont know anything about geography I dont know anything about motherfuckin French I know fuck all to be honest Im a dipshit French All I know is I dont even fucking know sometimes That sounds cheesy as shit to say quotFollow your dreamsquot Cause I dont even know if thats what I did I just literally saw Daryl Palumbo on a video Screamin his tits off and that looked like fun And I wanted to do that as a job I thought that would be cool And I dont have any musical skills I cant sing I mean I can sing now kind of but you know We use Autotune and shit And I cant sing well I just have passion and lyrics And I just beg and I borrow and I steal and rip people off You know like you got Like quotnihilist bluesquot that melody Someone said quotOh thats Evanescencequot Im like quotYeah must have

to do And so many so so many people have such fucking shit lives That sucks so much it breaks my heart so much Because fuckin I dont know Like every we just look at things Cause were human we think that How do I say this without people gettin pissed off at me Like humans are all aligned but you can tell If you look at any other creatures eyes Its were all here we all feel were all scared We all got that fuckin feeling in our stomachs that make us wanna kill ourselves Its always too much And its so fuckin unfair that theres people at the top And people at the bottom And theres animals at the bottom And theres animals gettin grinded into fucking shit And theres slaves and just I mean Im guilty Im a fuckin Like I aint a saint but I love everyone and everything so much I really honestly do I got one I just I want the best for all Cause what if its like it sounds mad as fuck But people believe in God dont they And people believe in people looking down on us and shit like that So its not that mad to think that what if this is a classroom Teacher room What if people are watching us What if something bigger is looking down on us Seeing how we do And seeing if were good enough for the next stage Cause we need to be better I need to get better I need to be a better person We all need to be better people Stop taste good or it feels good or how cool you look Or who likes you and shit We need to like fucking come together Its all cliche shit it just sounds such bullocks But we need to fuckin do this Were literally at the end doesnt it feel like that to you It feels like it to me Feels like were at the end of everything And it feels like its gonna be like some fuckin massive volcano Or eruption or fuckin tsunami will happen You know what thats what thats whats gonna happen Some fuckin mental disaster in a couple of years Like mental mental mental disaster Whether its natural or whatever And then everyones gonna go fuckin right we need to sort it out now We need to do something about this now But but we fuckin need to do something But we need to do it now And why not Its not that bad eatin like Yeah all right we get it meat tastes good And come on man theyre alive These things are living theyre living creatures Like what the fuck We dont need it Do you need it No and Im not Im a hypocrite Cause Ive got all this shit I dont need too But like I think we all need

Eminem,2014,Shady XV,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/rightforme.html,rap,I feel phenomenal as usual Pharmaceuticals glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo But I dont know if Im in Tennessee Chicago or Houston In the corner trying to seek solitude Shallow but such a hollow dude I wont even swallow solid food Alcoholic too plus Im on lean like the Tower of Pisa Top it off Im on mushrooms so fuck all of you Roses to violet mollies are blue Lost in a ball of confusion Its all an illusion Its probably the shrooms Im on Cause I think I started hallucinating Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Futures new shit And all I can do is follow the music And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza Fillin water balloons with nail polish remover Just a problem in wallowing fumes I feel uptight I gotta get looser After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution Concentrated like orange juice so Im not as diluted Cause all this delusion got me seein shit Excusezmoi but that coochie that passed You see her ass Wouldnt make her my main squeeze But juicier ass it belongs in a juicer Its mouth waterin too so I walked up to it like Im Marshall

assault that I use to smoke all of you losers Got a bazooka a shotgun a ruger a Glock and a nuke And a Rottweiler too Im not in the mood so When I say Im bringing the TEC out Im not coming to repair your fuckin electronic computers God Im gonna puke Im so gone off the hookah I think I swallowed a loofah Im tore up demolished a fuckin stone like Oliver Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her The thoughts I produce are loony tunes The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes To replace next up Veronicas boobs And a paychecks that were stuffed in a glove box In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues The girl was just not the one suitable for him  iHooki Right For Me will change me rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me donât laugh please listen Donât laugh please listen  Thought I could endure the pressure Collapse and crumble perhaps Relapsing under that Well thats a bunch of crap In the clutch Im the Captain Crunch of rap And Im sick of acting humble thats enough of that Fuck that shit cut the sack Like its a natural reaction Thats why Im actually trapped in this shoving match Cause push keeps coming to that I can keep getting my ass kicked keep it coming back Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit so mad Disgruntled had some struggles yeah But that passionate hungers back The fantastic juggling act And the way I flip my tongue on the track Its like verbal acrobatics But in fact Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic I fuckin crashed my hovercraft After I strapped the duffel bag to my back And stuck the massive punchin bag in it An elastic bungee strap proper plaster a thumb tack And a piece of plastic bubble wrap Went spastic and fuckin snapped Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid Stumbled back recovered back flipped And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat And for my last trick lunge on back lash On a NASA shuttle flap fuckin snapped the rudder in half Chuckled and laughed buttaled my last rebuttal And just asked him to come crash And I go grab my gogogadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress And ceramic construction hat Rubbed my magic mushroom tat Fell off then splat get up from that Face taped to a waste paper basket Throw up then gas lungs collapse And thats more likely than finding someone thats  iHooki  Couple of shots of JÃger Public intoxication disfuckincombobulation Flooded with thoughts of anger While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin quotYoure top ten aint chaquot stop cause you fuckers are talkin crazy And stop interrupting youre not even up in the conversation Whether youre punchin a clock or famous Underground pop or nameless whatever your job is I came to fuck with your occupation Youre thinkin just cause you came in with scrubs And you brought the scalpel and sponge The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon Stuck in the operating room Once you done swapped your name with him Smuggled in Ronald Reagan If you duck him up Donald Fagen While juggling waffles baking Fuckin McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle They flung it across the table Then bump it and knock it shake it Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration I said fuck it and lost my patience Since they all woke up from sedation Aint none of you Doctor Dre So then what does it got you thinkin That you can fuck with this operation Aftermath still running hiphop amazing Im still pluggin along No need for an assumption Heres confirmation Im up for the long duration Im just looking for something to walk away with Some pocket change and a little integrity Though Ill probably be jumpin across the stage Till Im fuckin Madonnas age and Stuck in an awkward place in my life But I shit you not like Im fucked up with constipation That day will come before I stumble upon some ladies  iHooki

Motionless in White,2010,Creatures,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/motionlessinwhite/countchoculitis.html,Rock\Alternatif,Love hollow hate sorrow  Undead undead Theres evil in my veins Undead undead The consummate revenge  How do you forgive the unforgivable How could you kill that which has no life You once were my sanctuary and now you are my prison  Loveless She says she wants to bleed Hopeless She says she wants to bleed  I wont let go I will not hurt Ive had all that I could take so I can just shut you out I wont let go I will not hurt You could never understand me Just walk away and dont say goodbye How can I shake this disease The marks on your neck would never lie  The quickest way to the heart is to cut right through the chest You must realize that someday you will die and until then you are worthless The best way to get over someone is to get on top of someone else and move on The best way to get over someone is to get on top of someone else and move on  You could never understand me Just walk away and dont say goodbye How can I shake this disease The marks on your neck would never lie  Why do I feel guilty for what you have done The worst part is showing you all the damage that youve caused  You could never understand me The marks on your neck would never lie
