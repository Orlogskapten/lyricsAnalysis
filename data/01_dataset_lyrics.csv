Falling In Reverse,2015,Just Like You,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fallinginreverse/waitandsee.html,metal,This is where we begin  Calling all cars its an emergency listen Ladies and gentlemen we are at the end of existence The television is fiction its telling lies to our vision Its like a prison that we live in and were all in the system  We live in a box and keep our family traditions We keep our guns cocked stocked up with more ammunition We teach our children to kill instead of teaching them wisdom And politicians waging wars blame it all on religion  Were dying Im feeling like Im losing it again The only person that were losing is yourself to this Im trying to be all that they want me to be But its hard to believe we are the enemy  Will you wait and see When the world stops spinning and were all pretending to be okay But its hard to be when you find out its fake  Humanity is trapped in a prison Open up your eyes See the vision Wait and see When the world stops spinning I wont stop pretending to be  Calling all people were in a state of confusion Because we hate what we love and its like a drug we abuse it And were polluting solutions and were all equal as humans Truly united we stand damn lets connect through the music  All this hatred Im seeing but its all an illusion People using social media to hurt us its stupid And all these kids just feel the need to cut themselves on their wrist The type of shit their parents miss because theyre losing their grip  Were dying Im feeling like Im losing it again The only person that were losing is yourself to this Im trying to be all that they want me to be But its hard to believe we are the enemy  Will you wait and see When the world stops spinning and were all pretending to be okay But its hard to be when you find out its fake  Humanity is trapped in a prison Open up your eyes See the vision Wait and see When the world stops spinning I wont stop pretending to be  What in the hell have we done to ourselves Brick by brick weve built this cell We are nothing left but a hollow shell hollow shell  Wait and see When the world stops spinning and were all pretending to be okay But its hard to be when you find out its fake  Will you wait and see When the world stops spinning and were all pretending to be okay But its hard to be when you find out its fake  Humanity is trapped in a prison Open up your eyes See the vision Wait and see When the world stops spinning I wont stop pretending to be When the world stops spinning I wont stop pretending to be When the world stops spinning I wont stop pretending to be okay But its hard to be when you find out its fake   
Eminem,2002,The Eminem Show,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/singforthemoment.html,rap,These ideas are nightmares to white parents Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings Like whatever they say has no bearing its so scary in a house that allows no swearing To see him walking around with his headphones blaring Alone in his own zone cold and he dont care Hes a problem child What bothers him all comes out when he talks about His fuckin dad walkin out Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out If he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out His thoughts are whacked hes mad so hes talkin back Talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap He sags his pants dorags and a stocking cap His stepfather hit him so he socked him back and broke his nose His house is a broken home theres no control he just lets his emotions go  Come on Sing with me Sing sing for the year Sing it Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Come on Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  Entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy only have one homie Only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great Or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate Its like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen From standin on corners and porches just rappin To havin a fortune no more kissin ass But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you To get their hands on every dime you have they want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all they kids be listenin to me religiously so Im signin CDs while police fingerprint me Theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me If Im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense Pete Its all political if my music is literal and Im a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl I couldnt I wouldnt be fit to youre full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you  Come on Sing with me Sing sing for the year Sing it Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing that shit Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and Ill get sued See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols And they want to get one cause they think the shits cool Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves we entertainers Of course the shits affectin our sales you ignoramus But music is reflection of self we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail Its fucked up aint it How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted Thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs Or for anyone whos ever been through shit in their lives Till they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe Were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in their eyes Thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it squeeze it and hold it Cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe theyll admit it when were gone Just let our spirits live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can  Sing with me Sing sing for the year Sing it Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Come on Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  Sing with me Sing sing for the year Sing it Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Come on Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Eminem,2014,Shady XV,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/shadyxv.html,rap,Im liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog Night club shit I was taught if your CDs on fire You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park no fire department So you might not hear sirens at all But dont be alarmed if I sound off Something just aint right with me dawg A martyr on a private charter whose life could be harder Widely regarded highly bite me sweetheart Im slightly retarded But tonight Im starting shit Im feeling self righteous I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit Looking to box with anybody disorderly conduct Ill fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith Fan of the LOX bananas manic Im going in shock Frantic Im trapped in a closet Panic attack cause Im claustrophobic No faggot I mean I cant maneuver from movement Cause I have no room for improvement Im practically squashed unpacked it and boxed it Toxic hands are arsenic flammable bars examine the content Bar exam start of insanity Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson Animal snarls cannibal jaws Shark mandibles lambs to the slaughter Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets Black out Zach Galifianakis gallons of Vodka But that gal has some knockers I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and Im conscious What happened doc I passed out again Alcohols making me break into vacants naked Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics Too close to the StairMaster Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it Woke up shortly thereafter hungover No underwear grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it Air Max in my closet preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich And the cross stitching is a cross mixing Of a rhinoceros possum skin giraffe and a dolphin Fin Dockers OshKoshes drop crotches Swatch watches and sneakers matches with the Parkers But its like being overstaffed at a boxing gym With all these trainers but I dont have any boxers And Im standing here naked hangover still wasted Like paper you write raps on obnoxious Yo why does it always sound like Im grabbing my nostrils Fuck that Ill battle em all Ill battle a mall Iâll stand there and yell that at a wall Until the mannequin doll scatter and the inanimate objects That Im battering all shatter and fall Cause I hear the track and Im starting to get fucking amped Imma spark plug Im like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking back Im a Duracell But I sure as hell got it backwards cause yall could get jumped And Id catch the battery charge but I got a hunch like your back when its arching When I start attacking your squadron Youll feel like MasterCard when Im charging So take a swipe at me Im coming straight at you Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers So get the sack of Wisconsin Thats nutbag that Im talking who am I kidding You faggots are all gonna do my bidding Dont get dragged to the auction Neiman Marcus bags of Vuitton and all Ill push a bitch into oncoming traffic just watch this Stretched tinted black sedan my ass See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping Affable guy next door is laughable My next whores gonna have mechanical arms Thatll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard I got a Magic Johnson Its like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me Ill laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around And all I see is Paulie Malign now shes slaughterhouse in a blouse And Madonna with mud on her God dammit I am misogynist I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster throw her off a balcony Just so happens shes fond of algae Cause now shes faceplants on the concrete Complete lack of responsibility Half you assholes aint strong enough to pick up a spirit Shit you fags couldnt shoplift at a thrift shop But I let the track lift em up boost the energy Klepto Im back to rip shop up but my thing is this now Fivefinger discount Been rapping so long Ive been killing this shit its easy Kidnapping your mom cause Im still in this bitch thievery Ransom for JonBenÃt Ramsey Chandra Levy and Gary Condit quotEmquot Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde I might relapse get on some bullshit Perhaps Ill launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson Macklemore Mac Miller and Asher Roth And have some back and forths And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamars quotControlquot verse And perform quotFackquot in concert iquotFackquot playsi Yo I put that shit on a greatest hits album Now that was awesome It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like Ill stick around And put up with my crap so long for Whats the attraction mama Is it the fact that Im a walking talking actual quadruple entendre Or the pointy nose thats pointing at you mama Who knows at this point its always poking so meh Still get along with this voice cause thats the monster So dosido with a sociopath everyone who knows me knows that What they dont know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio meh She loves the way I lie Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow Pathological liar oh why am I such an asshole That my disguise is pants but they

Eminem,2013,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/sofar.html,rap,I own a mansion but live in a house A kingsize bed but I sleep on the couch Im Mister Bright Side glass is halffull But my tanks half empty gasket just blew  This always happens Thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin only option I haves McDonalds bathroom In a public stall droppin a football so every time someone walks in the John I get Maddened quotShady what upquot What Come on man Im crappin And youre askin for my goddamn autograph on a napkin Oh thats odd I just happened To run out of tissue yeah hand me that on second though Id be glad then quotThanks dog Names Todd a big fanquot I Wiped my ass with it crumbled it up in a wad threw it back and Told im quotTodd youre the shitquot Whens all of this crap end Cant pump my gas without causin an accident Pump my gas cut my grass I cant take out the fuckin trash Without someone passin through my sub harassin Id count my blessings but I suck at math Id rather wallow than bask suffering succotash but the ant Acid it gives my stomach gas When I mix my corn with my fuckin mashed Potatoes so what hoe kiss my country bumpkin ass Missouri southern roots what the fuck is upper class Call lunch dinner call dinner supper Tupperware in the cupboard plastic ware up the ass Stuck in the past iPod what the fuck is that BBoy to the core mule Im as stubborn as  Maybe thats why I feel so strange Got it all but I still wont change Maybe thats why I cant leave Detroit Its the motivation that keeps me going This is the inspiration I need I could never turn my back on a city that made me And quotlifes been good to me so farquot  They call me classless I heard that I second and third that Dont know what the fuck Id be doin if it werent rap Probably be a giant turd sack But I blew never turned back Turned forty and still sag Teenagers act more fuckin mature Jack Fuck you gonna say to me Ill leave on my own terms ass Hole Im going berserk my nerves are bad But I love the perks my work has I get to meet famous people look at her dag Her nylons are ran her skirts snagged and I heard she drag races iburpi swag Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag Youre Danica Patrick yeah word skag Wed be the perfect match cause youre a vacuum Im a dirtbag My apologies No disrespect to technology But what the hecks all of these buttons You expect me to sit here and learn that Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda Be an expert at computers Id rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica Hell with PlayStation Im still on my first man on some Zelda Nintendo bitch Run jump punch stab and I melt the Mozzarella on my spaghetti put it on bread make a sandwich with Welchs And belch they say this spray butters bad for my health But I think this poor white trash from the trailer Jed Clampett Fred Sanford and welfare mentality helps to Keep me grounded thats why I never take full advantage of wealth I managed to dwell Within these parameters Still crammin the shelves full of Hamburger Helper I cant even help it this is the hand I was dealt a Creature of habit feel like Im trapped in an animal shelter With all these pet peeves God damn it to hell I cant stand all these kids with their camera cellphones I cant go anywhere I get so mad I could yell the Other day someone got all elaborate And stuck a head from a fuckin dead cat in my mailbox Went to Burger King they spit on my onion rings I think my karmas catching up with me  Maybe thats why I feel so strange Got it all but I still wont change Maybe thats why I cant leave Detroit Its the motivation that keeps me going This is the inspiration I need I could never turn my back on a city that made me And quotlifes been good to me so farquot  Got friends on Facebook all over the world Not sure what that means they tell me its good So Im artist of the decade I even got a plaque Id hang it up but the frame is all cracked  Im tryin to be lowkey hopefully nobody notices me In produce hunched over giant nose bleed Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me Embarrassed I just did Comerica with Hova the shows over Im hidin in Krogers buyin groceries He just had frontrow seats told me to sign his poster then insults me quotWow up close didnt know you had crows feetquot Im at a crossroads lost still shopping at Costcos Sloppy Joes bulk waffles Got caught pickin my nose aaghh look over see these two hot hoes Finger still up one of my nostrils Right next to em stuck at the light the fuckin shits Takin forever to change its stuck these bitches are lovin it Rubbin it in chucklin Couldnt do nothin play it off quotWhat you bumpinquot quotTrunk Muzik Yelawolfs betterquot fuckin bitch They want me to flip at the label but I wont succumb to it The pressure they want me to follow up with a Nother one after Recovery was so highly coveted But what good is a fuckin recovery if I fumble it Cause Imma drop the ball if I dont get a grip hoppin out shrubbery on you sons of bitches Wrong subdivision To fuck with bitch quit snappin fuckin pictures of my kids I love my city But you pushed me to the limit What a pity The shit I complain about Its like there aint a cloud in the sky and its rainin out KoolAid stain on the couch Ill never get it out But bitch I got an elevator in my house ants and a mouse Im livin the dream  Maybe thats why I feel so strange Got it all but I still wont change Maybe thats why I cant leave Detroit Its the motivation that keeps me going This is the inspiration I need I could never turn my back on a city that made me And quotlifes been good to me so farquot

Eminem,2018,Kamikaze,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/steppingstone.html,rap,Take me to the river Yeah yeah yeah yeah  Its 2002 everything was totally new We were globally huge watching sales go through the roof We wrote and we feuded Runyon Avenue soldiers included A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse We were so bulletproof wrote souped and soaked in our youth Thought we was running shit til we lost the sole of our shoe The death of Doody broke us in two We were thrown for a loop aint none of us know what to do And at the time I was going through my own struggles too So I wasnt in no condition to be coaching us through Everyone tried to go solo really nobody blew I was hoping they do so I aint have to shoulder the crew The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew How to stand on their own and I dont wanna open up wounds I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died so did the group Shootâ  If I could leave this all behind I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line Down to the river with you Help me leave this all behind  Ima wash away my sins Ima rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From it I pray that I dont fall Cause on the way back down I may End up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones  It was never the same and its bothered me since And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets The more time goes by the more life happens And we gotta be men we got responsibilities Plus we dont say how we feel And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle were in Been with you guys thick and thin But its almost as if sometimes were not even friends Which reminded me Biz quotRockstarquot was the shit Yall coulda got you a hit without me on the shit If you woulda put D12 on it wish I coulda did More than try talking you into coming up off of it I know it wasnt my fault but part of it probably is I think of all of the trips to BET And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with Maybe yall coulda clicked and got you some features But thats water under the bridge But Im washing my sins in it til my conscience is cleansed  If I could leave this all behind I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line Down to the river with you Help me leave this all behind  Ima wash away my sins Ima rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From it I pray that I dont fall Cause on the way back down I may End up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones  Bacardi and Hen never thought the party would end One minute youre bodying shit but then your audience splits You can already sense the climate is starting to shift To these kids you no longer exist Went from rainin cats and dogs in this bitch To tiny drops little drips And by the time your reign is over youll hardly be missed You start thinking of all the artists you dissed All the carnage you left is this the kind of karma you get For turning your fucking back on Bizzy Kuniva and Swift A Freudian slip subconsciously I honestly wished I aint feel so much guilt and yall didnt harbor resentment But its hard to pretend that yall aint got none I just wish I had words but I guess there just are none for this To my partners I cant say how sorry I am This is not how I planned for our story to end I love all of you men But I just cant be the guy everybody depends On for entire careers cause thats not even fair I will always be here but that spark isnt there And I dont know how to recapture that time and that era Ive tried hearkening back to but Im fighting for air Im barely charting myself Feels like Im on the descent but it was not my intent To treat yall like a stepping stone Though I aint left no one behind but we been down every road Done all we possibly can I know we kept our hopes up But the longer we spend living this lie that we live The less is left for closure so lets let this go Its not goodbye to our friendship but D12 is over  Ima wash away my sins Ima rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From it I pray that I dont fall Cause on the way back down I may End up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones

Eminem,2004,Encore,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/yellowbrickroad.html,rap,What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough If you will to be Saved not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children We seem to be approaching an age of the gross We all have this idea that we should Move up a little bit from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better  All right come on lets cut the bullshit enough Lets get it started lets start addressing this issue and open it up Lets take this shit back to the basement And we can discuss statements thats made on this tape And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love The music we all enjoy The music you accuse me of tryna destroy Lets rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit Crossing 8 Mile into Warren into hick territory Id like to share a story this is my story and cant nobody tell it for me You have well informed me I am well aware that I dont belong here Youve made that perfectly clear I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere From BelAir shopping center just for stopping in there From the black side all the way to the white side OK theres a bright side a day that I might slide You may call it a pass I call it hauling my ass Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks Oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks Them good old notorious so wellknown tracks  So lets go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  Come on lets go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  Id roam the streets so much theyd call me a drifter Sometimes Id stick up a thumb just to hitchhike Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke And steal a god damn bike from somebodys backyard And drop it off at the park that was the halfway mark To meet Kim had to walk back to her mamas on Chalmers after dark To sneak me in the house when Im kicked out my moms Thats about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps At Osbourne handing out some flyers he was doing some talent shows At Center Line High I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime He looked at me like Im out my mind shook his head like quotWhite boys dont know how to rhymequot I spit out a line and rhymed quotbirthdayquot with quotfirst placequot And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit where compound syllables sound combined From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew wed meet again somewhere down the line  So lets go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  Come on lets go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  My first year in 9th grade cant forget that day at school It was cool til your man MC Shan came through And said that Pumas The Brand cause the Klan makes Troops It was rumors but man god damn they flew Mustve been true because man we done banned they shoes I had the new ones the Cool J Ice Lamb suede too But we just threw em in the trash like they yesterdays news Guess who came through next XClan debut Professor X vanglorious exists in a state of red black and green With a key sissies now with this being a new trend We dont fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums Blackness is in African symbols and medallions Represents Black Power and we aint know what it meant Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall with em All over our necks like were showing em off not knowing at all We was being laughed at quotYou aint even half blackquot You aint supposed to have that homie let me grab that And that Flavor Flav clock we gon have to snatch that All I remember is meeting back at Manixs basement Saying how we hate this how racist but dope the X Clans tape is Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time She was tryna twotime me and there was this black girl At our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me And oh the irony guess what her name was aint even gonna say it plus The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull her Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the quotOh Foolish Pridequot girl But Ive heard people say they heard the tape and it aint that bad But it was I singled out a whole race and for that I apologize I was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is shes still a hoe  So lets go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  Come on lets go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home
